# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# CV-Application

My first React project!
**The goal of this project was to**
- Get used to passing around props
- Using the 'useState' hook
- Creating and managing Components
- Writing HTML using JSX

### What it Does
1. Creates a CV based on data inputted into the initial Form
2. Can edit the previously added data, and it live updates on the CV
3. Can select which section's data is being create & edited
